Scripts for Raspberry pi 4

All of the scripts here are not special and might be put together based on different scripts. This is more of a library to keep scripts I want to use often or do for fun. If there is a credit to be added, I will.

->Expect bad jokes with the naming of some files and memes

NOTE: Scripts might work on different versions; scripts are only tested on a Pi 4 with four GB Memory.
